Project Title: Stroke Analyisis: Study by Logistic Regression

Desccription: This study looks at how logistic regression analyzes an example dataset in Kaggle. It aims to confirm Logistic Regression as a valid algorithm in studying strokes. 

It also looks at the rise and wide spread use of Logistic Regression across varied subjects especially in healthcare and briefly explores the reasons and limitations of Logistic Regression.
