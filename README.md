Project Title: Stroke Analyisis: Study by Logistic Regression

Desccription: This study looks at how logistic regression analyzes an example dataset in Kaggle. It aims to confirm Logistic Regression as a valid 

algorithm in studying strokes. 

It also looks at the rise and wide spread use of Logistic Regression across varied subjects especially in healthcare and briefly explores

the reasons and limitations of Logistic Regression.

Programs/Websites Used: R and Github

File Types Used: R(Quarto)/Github (HTML output files from R). HTML output file renamed to index.html and uploaded to Github repo: 

github.com/skw24/IDC6940-Capstone_SteveWongsPResentation

Installation Instructions: (1) Copy the file index.html to your computer and open it in a web browser. 

Running the Program: (1) open R studio or Rstudio server and download the program LR_ProjectFall2025SW.qmd. 

                     (2) install the Kaggle Dataset by Soriano found in Kaggle.com.
                     
                     (3) Change the QMD file to reference the dataset on your comp[uter.
                     
                     (4) Run the file

Features: The Dataset has 12 variables:
          
          (1) Unique ID
          
          (2) Categorical Variables (Gender, Hypertension, Heart Disease, Marital Status, WorkType, Residentialtype, SmokingStatus, Outcome Variable (stroke or no  Stroke)
          
          (3) Continous Variables (Age, Average Glucose Level, BMI)
